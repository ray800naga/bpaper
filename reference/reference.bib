  abstract = {As a primary means of communication, texts are used to implicitly or explicitly reflect emotions. Emotion or sentiment detection from text has emerged as an important and expanding research area to more clearly understand the actual feelings of humans. Most of the word representation models, such as Word2Vec or GloVe, project the words in vector space such that if words have similar context, then their representations are also very similar. However, according to the recent studies, this approach limits the success of studies in areas such as emotion detection. For instance, love and happy are emotionally similar words, but they may have a lower similarity score than emotionally dissimilar word such as happy and sad which have high co-occurrence frequency, as they are in similar contexts. Recently, researchers propose some methods based on the addition of emotional or sentimental information to the original word vectors. These have improved the vector representation of words and achieved better results in emotion detection or classification tasks. In this survey, we analyze in detail such recent text-based studies in the literature. We summarize their methods used, emotion models, data sources, findings, and performances.}

  abstract = {Two studies provided evidence that three independent and bipolar dimensions, pleasure-displeasure, degree of arousal, and dominance-submissiveness, are both necessary and sufficient to adequately define emotional states. In one study with 200 subjects, 42 verbal-report emotion scales were explored in regression analyses as functions of the three dimensions plus a measure of acquiescence bias. Multiple correlation coefficients showed that almost all of the reliable variance in the 42 scales had been accounted for. The specific definitions provided by these equations were replicated in a second study that employed 300 subjects' ratings of 151 emotion-denoting terms on semantic differential-type scales.}

In this study, we explore the difference between the emotional intensity of the writer and that of the readers with this dataset. We found that the reader cannot fully detect the emotions of the writer, especially anger and trust. In addition, experimental results in estimating the emotional intensity show that it is more difficult to estimate the writer{'}s subjective labels than the readers{'}. The large gap between the subjective and objective emotions imply the complexity of the mapping from a post to the subjective emotion intensities, which also leads to a lower performance with machine learning models.}
